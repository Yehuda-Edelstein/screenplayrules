            First things first, I think it's important to note that 99% of what
            you'll find in the screentour will not help improve your story's
            plot whatsoever.

            screenplay. Not how to pen{" "}

            Furthermore, this tour will not be covering formatting constants
            such as margins or spacing.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            If you don't already have a screenwriting software that does those
            things for you, I suggest you purchase one before continuing.

            Note: if you're not looking to spend any money yet, there are some
            free softwares (as well as free versions of{" "}
            <span id="italic">paid</span> softwares) you can find with a quick
            Google search.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            My point here is it's 2022. You should not be spacing your own
            screenplays unless you enjoy a good torture session.

            Lastly, you will see many "rules" on this tour.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The quotes are there because in truth art doesn't really have any
            rules. You can do whatever you want and it'll sometimes work.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <span className="divider">The key word is sometimes</span>
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The reality is no professional will read your script if the margins
            are off or if you use the wrong type of font. That's just a fact.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            So, it sometimes pays to follow the "rules", you know?

            <div className="blogSubHeader">WHO AM I</div>
            I'm a software engineer who enjoys screenwriting. I made this
            website both as a project, but also as a way to give back to the
            screenwriting community.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            To give a little background, I started writing screenplays a while
            back and found it difficult to learn the tricks of the trade by
            myself.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            How do I write music cues? <span id="italic">Should</span> I write
            music cues? What are music cues? Lots of questions and not a lot of
            cohesive answers.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Don't get me wrong, there's a plenty of good stuff out there in the
            ether, but it was very unorganized. My goal is that this website
            will help unite the screenwriting community. Connect pros with
            rooks. A Qs, and so on.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <div id="border"></div>
            Also, some of the terms found in the glossary, or in a section's
            local gloss', were invented by me.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Not that the concepts didn't already exist, just that I have given
            names to those that were nameless. For posterity. And because it was
            fun.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Anyways. Without further adieu. Let's start the tour. See: arrow on
            the screentour header.

            larger screen for a better learning experience. 690px and above is
            preferable

            these rules are not set in stone. As I mature as a writer so will
            the rules. Reason will prevail!
