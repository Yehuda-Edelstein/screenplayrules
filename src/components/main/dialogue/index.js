            <div className='blogText'>
                I didn't include a dialogue section only because any dialogue written should follow the same rules I described earlier in the action section. That being said, there are still a few rules regarding the writing of dialogue. 
                
                As for the other perenthtical <span id='courrier'>(OPTIONS)</span>, here's a list of acceptable ones found in scripts with a good screengrade:
            <br></br>
                

            </div>
            <div className='blogFooter'>
                <a href="intros" id='courrier'>BACK</a>
                <a href="transitions" id='courrier'>NEXT</a>
            </div> 
        </div>
    );
}

export default Dialogue;
